# testblank
"testblank" osu skin I created for high performance runs, with a focus on full combos.
This skin is best used by disabling scoreboards (tab), interfaces, (shift+tab) and key overlay (settings) and removing beatmap backgrounds. Don't expect to become an "instant pro" using this skin, but it should help in reducing visual clutter, helping you focus on the game rather than eye candy visuals that cloud your sight.

To install the skin simply place the zip file into the "Skins" folder of your osu directory and unzip the archive. You should be able to restart osu and have the options to use "testblank" and "testblank-nofollow" in the skin settings

# Features
- No numbers in hitobjects
- One common hitsound. Recommended sfx volume is 50-75%
- Only 2 hitobject colors
- "Spidersilk" follow lines that are barely noticeable
- Nice to use on both normal and bluescreen diminished monitors.


testblank: skin with follow lines.

testblank-nofollow: skin without follow lines. Looks very clean.
