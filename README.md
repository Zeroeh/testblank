# testblank
"testblank" osu skin I created for high performance runs, with a focus on full combos.
This skin is best used by disabling scoreboards (tab), interfaces, (shift+tab) and key overlay (settings) and removing beatmap backgrounds. Don't expect to become an "instant pro" using this skin, but it should help in reducing visual clutter.

To install the skin simply place the zip file into the "Skins" folder of your osu directory and unzip the archive. You should be able to restart osu and have the options to use "testblank" and "testblank-nofollow"

testblank: skin with follow lines.

testblank-nofollow: skin without follow lines. Looks very clean.
